## Cluster networking

- Pods can communicate with other pods, regardless the host with a different ip address
=> can be treated like VMs or physical host

- IP per pode 

- There are 4 distinct networking problems to solve:

Highly-coupled container-to-container communications
Pod-to-Pod communications
Pod-to-Service communications
External-to-internal communications
