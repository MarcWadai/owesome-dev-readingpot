An Introduction to DNS 
- Hierarchical distributed database with delegated authority, maps names to IP addresses
- Delegated authority ensure that those who know best about mapping names to IP addresses are the one responsible
- A name server in most cases maintains the records for a portion of the DNS name space called a zone. In many cases, the terms zone and domain seem synonymous, but theyâ€™re actually not the same thing. A zone comprises all the data for a given domain except those parts of the domain that are delegated to other name servers. 
- The main purpose for DNS is to map host names to IP addresses, and the data that makes that possible are stored as records in a zone file
